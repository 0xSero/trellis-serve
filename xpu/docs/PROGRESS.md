# Progress log (see GOAL.md)

All numbers: one B70, bench/sweep.py, cold unique prose prompts, thinking off, temp 0, raw rows in bench/results.jsonl.

## 2026-09-22

| step | decode C1 | C8 agg | C16 agg | C32 agg | C64 agg | prefill 4K | kept |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Triton v1, eager | 7.3 | 56 | 102 | – | – | 1008 | baseline |
| ESIMD GEMV (dp4a), eager | 14.4 | 100 | – | – | – | – | yes |
| + XPU decode graphs (1-8) | 28.4 | 102 | – | – | – | – | yes |
| + DPAS kernel M<=64, blocked xh, graphs 1-64 | 28.5 | 152 | 239 | 391 | 411 | 1019 | yes |

Gate A1 (bit-exact weights): quick run PASS on all shape classes incl. 6-bit lm_head (reconstruct, vector,
DPAS). Exact fp16 codebook costs ~4% at M=1 vs the unrounded variant; kept (bit-exactness is a gate).

llama.cpp baseline: pending (pinned GGUF + MTP draft downloading; local GGUF failed the image's SHA pin).

## Next
- llama.cpp baseline sweep (1 GPU; then 2 GPU split + MTP)
- prefill: ESIMD reconstruct is in; fuse Hadamards into reconstruct (original-basis W) and bigger chunks
- DP=2 across both B70s
- speculative decoding (DSpark draft), lm_head speed, fp8 KV
- Gate A3: logits vs exllamav3 on the 3090s (KL + top-1)

## 2026-09-23: goal v2 (one B70, MTP, 256K, vision)

Config: models/qwen3.8-27b-exl3-4.00bpw/model.yaml (MTP k=3, fp8 KV, max_model_len 262144, vision on).
Findings: the EXL3 repo already ships the MTP head (EXL3 4-bit, missing from quantization_config.json's
tensor_storage) and the vision tower (bf16). No grafting needed; plugin detects EXL3 modules from `.trellis`
entries in the weight index.

Harness bug fixed: with MTP, vLLM streams several tokens per SSE chunk; sweep.py counted chunks. Now counts
tokens (vLLM continuous_usage_stats; tokenizer fallback for llama.cpp). The earlier llama.cpp TP2+MTP cells
were undercounted the same way and must be re-measured.

| step | C1 prose | C1 code | notes | kept |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| MTP k=3, full-vocab draft head | 37.9 | 57.5 | C2 70.5 / C8 221.5 prose aggregate; accept len 3.72 | base |
| + pruned draft head (512 of 1940 vocab blocks, 98.6% corpus coverage) | **48.2** | 65.7 | accept len 3.71 (unchanged) | yes |
| k=4 (+ pruned head) | 44.4 | 72.8 | accept len 4.32; prose is the headline | no |
| k=5 | – | – | 256K KV does not fit (9.7 GiB needed, 9.5 free) | no |

Kernel steps (graph-captured linear budget, all 257 fused linears):
| step | M=1 | M=4 | kept |
|---|---|---|---|
| baseline | 33.2 ms | 41.0 ms | |
| split-K target 1024/2048/8192/16384 | 32.7 best | 40.7 | 1024 kept (marginal) |
| dp4a 0x6400 trick, loaded prev-words, fp16 partial dots (ISA 378 -> 300 instr/row) | 32.5 | 45.1 | yes for M=1 (bit-exact) |
| software-pipelined loads | 32.2 | 70.0 (spills) | no |
| DPAS with zero-padded A (M=2..8 flat ~36 ms) | – | 36.3 | yes; vector for M<=2 |
| K=6 tile pairing (32-lane decode), NT per case | lm_head 3.85 -> 3.46 ms | | yes |
Diagnosis: M=1 GEMV is co-limited by issue (~22 ms) and DRAM (~23.5 ms, 531 GB/s ceiling measured with decode
stripped); overhead outside the GEMV (Hadamards, gaps under graphs) is only 1.2 ms/step.

Prefill (linears of one 8192-token chunk):
| step | total | ceiling | kept |
|---|---|---|---|
| Triton Hadamards | 7.71 s | 1063 tok/s | |
| ESIMD row-major Hadamards | 4.31 s | 1902 tok/s | yes (GEMM ~140 TFLOPS, had 11%) |

### C1 decode investigation (2026-09-23, one B70, MTP k=3, deterministic prompt panel from here on)
The sweep now uses a fixed prompt sequence (`--seed panel-v1`) and records per-cell MTP acceptance
(vLLM /metrics deltas). Per-step time = acceptance_len / tok_s is the engine metric; prose acceptance on
this panel is ~2.4 (random prompts earlier gave 3.2-3.7, which made cross-run C1 comparisons noisy).

| step | C1 prose | ms/step | kept |
|---|---|---|---|
| baseline (pruned head, new kernels) | 47.4 @3.23* | – | |
| async scheduling | 45.8 | – | no (already default-on) |
| FULL_AND_PIECEWISE graphs (drafter captured), sizes<=32 | – | – | no: UR OUT_OF_RESOURCES |
| same, sizes [1,2,4,8] | 46.0 | – | no gain |
| C++ single-op linear (host 74 -> 34 us/call) | 47.4 | – | yes (cleaner, no loss) |
| GDN metadata sync patch (A/B on fixed panel) | 47.1 @2.41 vs 46.3 @2.38 | 51.1 vs 51.4 | yes (~1%) |
| DPAS K=4 contiguous-VNNI B build | M=4 linears 35.1 vs 36.2 ms | | yes (bit-exact) |
| DPAS natural-order decode / strided fp16 mad | 37.0 / 49.2 ms | | no |
| fused single-kernel linear (had_in + split-K last-arriver + had_out) | M=1 34.7 vs 32.5, M=4 45.2 vs 35.1 | | no (serialized tail; hads cost only ~1.2 ms/step under graphs) |
| lm_head verify on vector path (M=4) | 4.41 vs 3.57 ms DPAS | | no |
(*random-prompt acceptance)

Eager per-step GPU budget (C1, k=3): 50 ms = EXL3 GEMV/DPAS 40.8 + Hadamards 3.1 (eager launches; ~1.2 under
graphs) + GDN 1.6 + RMSNorm 1.5 + rest ~3. Same-GPU floors: vector M=1 32.5 ms full / 25.1 ms memory-only;
DPAS M=4 35.1 ms full / 33.5 ms without decode (structural B-build + dpas chain ~8 ms over the memory floor).

### Prefill, calibrated (2026-09-23)
Prompt generator fixed: random-word documents are ~3.5 tokens/word (not 1.9), so earlier "32K"/"128K" cells were
~58K/232K tokens. Prompts are now sized with the tokenizer (within 0.1%).

| ctx | prefill tok/s | TTFT | notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| 4K | 1665 | 2.5 s | |
| 32K | 1363 | 24 s | |
| 128K | 760 | 168 s | attention-bound (XPU FA2, head_dim 256) |
| 254K | 508 | 500 s | linears alone would allow ~1900 tok/s |

| step | result | kept |
|---|---|---|
| TRITON_ATTN backend | 32K: 43 tok/s (vs 1363 FA2) | no |
| DSpark block-7 draft (Qwen3DSparkModel arch fix) | C1 prose 30.3 @1.83, code 73.6 @4.48 (vs MTP 47.6 / 68.0) | no (prose headline) |
| draft vocab 256/384/512 blocks | C1 prose 47.7 / 47.2 / 47.6 | 512 kept (flat) |
| DPAS prev<<2 hoist | 35.23 vs 35.12 ms | no change |
GPU is PL2-throttled during decode: act 2600 MHz of 2800 (power1_cap 230 W, profile base); needs root to change.

### fp8-KV prefill attention at fp16 speed (2026-09-23)
Finding: vllm_xpu_kernels FA2 (head_dim 256, GQA 24:4) runs 69-74 TFLOPS on fp16 K/V but 39 TFLOPS on fp8 K/V
(bench/attn_bench.py). Server A/B at 128K: fp16 KV 1016 tok/s vs fp8 KV 760 tok/s. 256K only fits one B70 with fp8 KV.
Fix (exl3xpu/fp8kv_prefill.py + vllm_patches.patch_fp8kv_prefill): for single-sequence prefill chunks (>=64
queries, >=4K context, not under graph capture) gather the cached K/V in 32K-key blocks, dequantize to fp16,
run the fp16 kernel per block (causal only for the chunk's own keys), merge with log-sum-exp.
Correctness: tests/test_fp8kv_prefill.py (rel <= 4e-4 vs one full fp16 pass); needle recall at 128K: 3/3 depths.
Harness fix: prefill prompts are built (tokenizer-sized) before the clock starts.

| ctx | before (fp8 KV) | after | target |
|---|---|---|---|
| 4K | 1665 | 1612 | ok |
| 32K | 1363 | 1531 | ok |
| 128K | 760 | 1059 | ok |
| 254K | 508 | 763 | open: needs an attention kernel ~1.6x faster than XPU FA2 at head_dim 256 |

### Gate status (2026-09-23, one B70, MTP k=3 + pruned draft head, fp8 KV 256K, vision)
| gate | result |
|---|---|
| T1 C1 prose >= 50 tok/s | 47.6 (panel acceptance 2.4); code 68.0 |
| T2 prefill >= 1000 | 4K 1612, 32K 1531, 128K 1059 pass; 254K 763 |
| T3 256K on one card | pass (KV 265,888 tokens, 1.02x) + needle 3/3 at 128K |
| T4 C2 / C8 | prose 85 / 239, code 120 / 349 aggregate |
| T5 vision | pass |
| T6 MTP identity | 5/8 exact; divergence at a 0.016-nat top-2 tie (numerics, not a bug) |
| A1 bit-exact weights | pass |
| A3 logits vs exllamav3 (3090) | pass: top-1 99.63%, KL 9.8e-5 nats over 16,320 positions |

Rejected this round: TRITON_ATTN (43 tok/s at 32K); 256-GRF DPAS (NT=4 44.4 / NT=8 53.7 vs 35.1 ms);
work-group 4/16/32 and split-K 2048 (all worse than local 8 / 1024).
Bounds: XPU FA2 = 69 TFLOPS (fp16) at head_dim 256, the only FA version shipped. 254K prefill at 69 TFLOPS
attention + ~130 TFLOPS GEMMs caps near 800 tok/s; even a 100 TFLOPS attention kernel gives ~960.
GPU runs 2600 MHz of 2800 under decode (~47 W card power; 230 W cap; power profile 'base').

### Custom ESIMD flash-attention (user-requested, 2026-09-23)
csrc/fa_esimd.h: fp16, head_dim 256, GQA, causal (bottom-right), O + LSE; 2D block loads (K^T transposed = VNNI,
V VNNI-transformed), 8 query rows/thread, 256-GRF, online softmax base 2. tests/test_fa_esimd.py.
| version | 8K causal | 8K x 32K | vs FA2 | kept |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| v1 exact rescale | 48.2 TF | 37.7 TF | FA2 61.3 / 75.2 TF | kept as experiment, not wired |
| v2 lazy rescale (TAU=8) | 45.3 TF | 36.7 TF | no gain, rel err 1e-5 -> 4e-4 | reverted |
Diagnosis: at head_dim 256 an 8-row fp32 O accumulator is 8 KB of the 16 KB GRF, so a thread cannot hold more
query rows to reuse K/V tiles; ~8 FLOP/byte of L1 traffic per thread (x6 GQA heads re-reading the same tiles)
puts ~100+ TFLOPS beyond Xe2 L1 bandwidth. 1000 tok/s at 256K needs ~117 TFLOPS attention: not credible on one B70.

### Full sweep (2026-09-23, B70 #1 — B70 #0 was running the user's llama.cpp service)
Config: models/qwen3.8-27b-exl3-4.00bpw/model.yaml (MTP k=3, pruned draft head, fp8 KV 267,761 tokens, 256K
max len, max_num_seqs 16, image+video). Deterministic prompts (panel-v1), greedy. Aggregate tok/s (per-stream).

| C | prose off | code off | prose think | code think |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | 47.2 (47.0) | 66.7 (66.3) | 61.4 (56.6) | 48.5 (47.7) |
| 2 | 83.2 (42.7) | 119.8 (60.0) | 110.8 (54.1) | 82.7 (41.6) |
| 4 | 138.6 (35.5) | 200.4 (50.0) | 175.6 (42.5) | 144.1 (35.0) |
| 8 | 236.3 (30.5) | 345.3 (43.5) | 299.6 (37.9) | 234.1 (29.0) |
| 16 | 180.7 (18.2) | 264.9 (22.9) | 240.5 (23.2) | 184.4 (18.1) |
Prefill (cold): 4K 1589, 32K 1497, 128K 1049 tok/s. Vision + video tests pass. Audio: not supported by the model.

C16 < C8 diagnosed: a C16 verify is M=64 tokens; the MB=64 DPAS kernel (1 tile/thread) took 124 ms for all
linears vs 50.6 ms at M=32. Fixes measured (all linears, M=64): 2x MB=32 blocks 100 ms; MB=64 NT=1 256-GRF 105 ms;
MB=64 NT=2 256-GRF 87.3 ms (kept, bit-exact); MB=32 NT=4 256-GRF regressed M=32 (60.4 vs 50.7, not kept).

After the MB64 fix, C8/C16 re-measured on B70 #1: think off prose C8 238.4 / C16 233.1, code C8 344.1 / C16 332.5;
think on prose C8 318.1 / C16 294.7, code C8 239.8 / C16 REQ_FAIL. The C16 failure was a UR DEVICE_LOST in
graph replay at 12:09: the kernel log shows a job timeout on c3:00.0 at the same second another session's
llama.cpp engine was started on that card (our engine was at 91.5% VRAM). Repro of the cell on the idle B70 #0:
new MB64 (NT2, 256-GRF) 240.2 agg (23.3/stream, accept 2.27) with no errors; old MB64 197.3 (19.3/stream),
also clean. Not a kernel bug; MB64 fix confirmed +22% on the cell. C16 still == C8 on think-on code: next is
profiling the non-linear per-step cost at C16.

### Split-K sizing retune (2026-09-23), kept
C16 eager profile (25 verify steps): DPAS MB64 56 ms/step, GDN spec kernel 13.3, HadOut 9.2 (33 us/call vs
HadIn 5 us), lm_head 4.2, FA2 2.8, draft ~3.8; ~97 ms GPU vs ~150 ms wall per step (rest is host).
HadOut was slow because split-K was sized for 4096 threads: o_proj/out_proj/down at M=64 split K 26 ways
(~34 MB of fp32 partials per call). All linears, graph-captured (bench/linear_budget.py), 4096 -> 1024 threads:
M=1 36.1->32.5, M=2 38.5->33.5, M=4 41.4->35.7, M=16 49.3->39.1, M=32 54.4->50.6 ms (repeated, stable);
M=64 best at 2048: 87.7->77.0 ms. New defaults 1024 / 2048 (MB=64); env EXL3_TARGET_THREADS(_MB64).
Gate A1 PASS (401 tensors). Served, thinking on (agg tok/s, before -> after): C1 prose 61.4->68.6, code
48.5->56.9; C8 prose 318.1->326.0, code 239.8->262.5; C16 prose 294.7->305.5, code 240.2->249.6.
T1 now passes on both classes (code 56.9 >= 50).

### load_words without the p-1 reload (2026-09-23), kept; DPAS word prefetch, rejected
All linears (graph-captured, mean of 2 alternating reps), base -> prev-from-registers: M=1 32.5 -> 29.2,
M=4 35.4 -> 35.2, M=16 39.0 -> 37.8, M=64 76.8 -> 67.7 ms. Gate A1 PASS. Double-buffered trellis words in
DpasKernel (EXL3_DPAS_PREFETCH): M=16 39.0 -> 86.4 ms (register spill), M=64 76.8 -> 79.2: rejected.
Served (B70 #1, think off, agg tok/s, full-v2 -> prev-from-regs): C1 prose 53.9 -> 53.7, code 75.3 -> 75.9;
C8 prose 253.8 -> 265.4, code 371.4 -> 390.0; C16 prose 241.5 -> 262.7, code 349.0 -> 374.5. Kept.

### DPAS MB<=16 split-K target 1408 (2026-09-23)
Target-thread sweep for DPAS MB=8/16 (all linears, graph-captured, B70 #1): 1024: M=4 35.1, M=16 38.7 ms;
1280-1536 plateau: M=4 32.1-32.3, M=16 36.0-36.2; 1664+: 36.4 / 41.3 (cliff); 2048: 38.6 / 44.4. MB=32 stays
at 1024 (47.6 vs 49.6 at 1536); MB=64 flat 1408-2048 (67.9-68.6), stays 2048. Vector kernel at M=3/4
(VECMAX=4): 45.7 / 44.6 ms vs DPAS 35: rejected. New default MB<=16 1408 (env EXL3_TARGET_THREADS_MB16).
Gate A1 PASS. After: M=1 29.4, M=4 33.4, M=16 36.2, M=32 47.9, M=64 69.3 ms.
Served (B70 #1, agg tok/s, full-v2 -> MB<=16 1408 + prev-from-regs): think off C1 prose 53.9 -> 56.6, code
75.3 -> 79.2; C2 97.3 -> 104.2 / 137.6 -> 147.7; C4 170.7 -> 184.3 / 240.1 -> 254.7. Think on C1 prose
64.5 -> 70.3, code 54.3 -> 58.3; C2 122.5 -> 122.7 / 97.8 -> 106.2; C4 223.0 -> 237.5 / 173.0 -> 187.0. Kept.
Decode-cost probe (EXL3_DEBUG_NODECODE / NOSTATE builds): inconclusive, codegen changes dominate (M=1 29.2 ->
94.9 ms with decode removed); not a usable bound.
DPAS MB=8 tiles/thread (EXL3_DPAS8_NT), all linears, 2 reps: NT=4 (current) M=4 31.7-31.8, M=8 33.1-33.2 ms;
NT=2 41.9-42.1 / 42.7-43.1; NT=8 49.9-50.0 / 51.4-52.3. Rejected (NT=4 stays).
Async scheduling at C8/C16 (think off, confirmed enabled in the engine log): C8 prose 268.3 -> 268.9, code
389.1 -> 389.9; C16 prose 265.9 -> 261.1, code 378.0 -> 372.1. No gain: rejected. The ~48 ms/step gap vs the
eager-mode GPU sum is not overlappable host work; next C16 step is a graph-mode profile to re-derive it.
FULL_AND_PIECEWISE (drafter graphs), sizes [1,2,4,8,16,32,48,64]: UR OUT_OF_RESOURCES at capture_begin of the
2nd PIECEWISE size (Level Zero graph-resource limit; piecewise splits 64 layers into many subgraphs). Rejected.
DPAS MB=4 (repeat count 4, opt-in EXL3_DPAS_MB4): outputs bitwise identical to MB=8 (24 layer/M cases), all
linears 2 reps: M=3 31.9-32.0 -> 31.5-32.6, M=4 32.6-32.8 -> 32.0-32.1 ms (NT=4; NT=8 no better). Within noise:
M=4 is decode/memory-bound, not DPAS-bound. Rejected (left opt-in).
mul1 codebook as two 16x16 multiplies (EXL3_MUL16): Gate A1 PASS but slower everywhere (2 reps): M=1 29.4 ->
34.4, M=4 32.9 -> 39.4, M=16 36-38 -> 43.4, M=64 69.3 -> 78.0 ms. Rejected (left opt-in).

### 32K-context decode cells (2026-09-23, B70 #1, v3 build)
C1 x 32K: per-stream decode prose 50.3, code 71.8 tok/s (0-context: 56.6 / 79.2); aggregate 26.4 / 34.1 because
the 21-35 s prefill falls in the 60 s window. C4 x 32K (150 s warm-up): aggregate 3.4 prose / 1.6 code, TTFT
39-59 s: prefill-bound, every stream re-prefills a fresh 32K prompt per few hundred output tokens.
max_num_batched_tokens 2048 / 4096 vs 8192: prefill 4K 1568 / 1666 vs 1589, 32K 1407 / 1474 vs 1497; C4 x 32K
unchanged (2.8 / 13.2 and 2.7 / 1.5). Kept 8192. Cells recorded with PREFILL_IN_WINDOW / PREFILL_BOUND flags.

### C16 thinking-on concurrency (2026-09-23)
Engine log at C16 think-on: Running 10 / Waiting 6 at 91.5% KV; 8 running = 73%; 1 running = 9.2%. One stream
of ~2.1K tokens holds ~12 of ~131 blocks: the hybrid allocator uses one page size for all KV-cache groups; the
GDN state (3.1 MiB/layer, padded 4 MiB) forces 2048-token attention blocks under fp8 KV, and each group
allocates whole blocks. mamba_cache_mode default (drop align): C8/C16 prose 354.0/332.8, code 268.2/274.5
(vs 355.2/327.0, 275.5/270.9): noise, same 10 running. enable_prefix_caching=false: 346.6/336.9, 268.9/267.7,
same 10 running. Both rejected. Lever left: GDN state dtype (page size), needs a quality check (Gate A3).
GDN state dtype: vLLM "auto" already stores the temporal state in the model dtype (fp16; config.json asks fp32),
so the 3.1 MiB page is the fp16 size; lower would be fp8 state (quality risk). fp16 attention KV halves the block
but also halves pool tokens (256K no longer fits). Conclusion: C16 thinking-on stays allocator-bound (KV_BOUND);
C16 prose 327-337 vs C8 346-355.

### MTP draft length, thinking on (2026-09-23, v3 build, B70 #1)
agg tok/s C1 prose / C1 code / C4 prose / C4 code: k=2 61.9 / 55.3 / 219.5 / 187.6; k=3 70.3 / 58.3 / 237.5 /
187.0; k=4 75.8 / 59.5 / 215.0 / 159.4. k=4 wins C1 (+8% prose), k=3 wins C4 (k=4 -9%/-15%). Next: vLLM dynamic
SD schedule (num_speculative_tokens_per_batch_size) to use k=4 at batch 1 and k=3 above.
Dynamic SD schedule [[1,1,4],[2,64,3]]: forces PIECEWISE mixed capture -> UR OUT_OF_RESOURCES (12 sizes: fails
at 5/12; sizes [5,8,16,32,64]: also fails). Rejected on this driver. Fixed k stays 3 (k=4 is the C1-only option).
DSpark block-7 draft, thinking on (v3 build, max_model_len 32K as before): C1 prose 62.6 / code 22.0, C4 prose
106.9 / code 88.0 (MTP k=3: 70.3 / 58.3 / 237.5 / 187.0), accept 2.44. Rejected for thinking-on.

### K=6 planar trellis words (lm_head) (2026-09-23), kept
K=6 has D=3 words per period, so the per-value word gathers used stride-3 register regions (Xe regions only
stride by powers of two -> per-element moves, 2 per unrolled value). Words are now de-interleaved once per tile
into D contiguous planes (GEMV: contiguous selects; DPAS B-build: <P,1,8,P> instead of <P,3,8,6>). K=4 (D=1)
unchanged. Gate A1 PASS; outputs bitwise identical (24 layer/M cases). lm_head (1.27 GB, 6-bit): M=1 4.05 ->
1.72 ms (235 -> 555 GB/s), M=4 3.82 -> 2.00, M=16 4.03 -> 2.20, M=64 5.38 -> 4.13. All linears: M=1 29.4 ->
27.3, M=4 33.2 -> 31.7, M=16 36.2 -> 34.0-34.9 ms. (Opt-out: EXL3_NO_PLANAR.)
Fused single-kernel linear (exl3_set_fused 1) re-tested on the current build: M=1 27.2 -> 28.4, M=4 31.4 -> 45.9 ms
(small layers worse too: out_proj 366 -> 295 GB/s). Still rejected.
Per-layer split-K target at M=1 (TARGET 512/1024/2048/4096): 1024 is best for every layer type (out_proj 344/367/
340/284 GB/s, o_proj 339/360/337/279, down_proj 391/446/350/371). The small projections' ~360 GB/s is fixed
per-call overhead (Hadamard kernels + gaps, ~5-8 us on a ~26 us GEMV), worth ~1 ms/step in total.
Full (unpruned) MTP draft head after the K=6 planar lm_head (thinking on, agg): C1 prose 76.9 -> 73.8, code
61.4 -> 59.6; C4 245.7 -> 231.4, 199.4 -> 183.3; acceptance ~unchanged. Pruned 512-block head stays.
Draft vocab blocks after the planar lm_head (thinking on, agg C1 prose / C1 code / C4 prose / C4 code):
256: 73.5 / 58.9 / 242.2 / 187.1 (accept 2.75/2.29); 384: 76.7 / 59.2 / 243.6 / 197.2; 512: 76.9 / 61.4 / 245.7 /
199.4; full: 73.8 / 59.6 / 231.4 / 183.3. 512 stays.

### C1 thinking-on graph-mode profile (planar build, 145 steps, ~41 ms/step)
Outside the captured target graph, per step: target lm_head (M=4) 1.78 ms, draft lm_head 3 x 0.49 ms, draft-layer
linears ~1.3 ms, FA2/argmax/reduce ~0.8 ms: ~5.7 ms GPU. The graph (target linears ~30 ms + attention/GDN) is the
rest; ~146 small aten::copy_ per step cost ~6 ms CPU but overlap with GPU work. C1 is GPU-bound on the M=4
target linears (31.7 ms, 415 GB/s; decode-bound: MB=4 and vector-kernel variants measured no better).
LSC L1/L2 prefetch of trellis words EXL3_PF_DIST rows ahead (GEMV + DPAS, opt-in EXL3_L1_PF), all linears 2 reps:
dist 1: M=1 27.1-27.2, M=4 30.6-31.7, M=16 34.2-35.1; dist 2: 27.6-27.7 / 30.6-31.4 / 34.6-35.2; dist 4: 28.6 /
31.2-31.9 / 35.2-36.4; current: 27.2 / 31.3-31.5 / 34.6-34.7 ms. Noise or worse: rejected (left opt-in).

### ISA read of the K=4 DPAS loop; Gate A1 coverage fix (2026-09-23)
IGC dump of DpasKernel<4,2,8,4>: ~300 instructions per K-row for 32 decode groups of 32 values, i.e. ~9 SIMD32
per group: shl(:w) / shr(:ud) / or(:w) / mul (single native d x uw) / dp4a / mov (fp16 view copy) / mad(:hf), plus
~2 SIMD32-equivalent moves duplicating the 16-lane word region into both 32-lane halves. Decode is already
near the integer-ALU roofline (~25 ms of ALU work per step vs 27-31 ms measured for M<=4).
- EXL3_DECODE_INLINE (strided fp16 view straight into the mad): no change (27.2 / 31.4 ms), IGC still copies.
- EXL3_K4_HALVES (two 16-lane halves reading the region directly): timed -4% at M<=16, but its OUTPUTS WERE
  WRONG (abs err up to 120 at M=3..8). Rejected.
- Gate A1 only exercised vector M=4 and DPAS M=64, so the production MB=8/16/32 DPAS and vector M=1/2 paths were
  untested at the weight level. tests/test_bitexact_xpu.py now also checks vector M=1/2 and DPAS M=3/8/16/32 on a
  128-row sample per tensor; it catches the halves bug, and the production kernel passes (GATE_A1_PASS, 401 tensors).

### MB=64 DPAS kernel analysis (2026-09-23)
ISA (256-GRF, no GRF spills; 102 predicate-flag spill loads in the epilogue store chain): IGC hoists part of the next
tile's decode ahead of each 8-dpas burst. Per 16x16 tile per XVE: decode ~144 cycles (72 SIMD32 ALU), DPAS ~128
(8 x dpas.8x8), serial sum ~272; measured ~423 (67 ms, 52 TFLOPS). Every layer type is equally slow at M=64
(gate_up 199 GB/s with P=1, lm_head 232), so it is not split-K partials. (A first guess, activation reload from L1,
was wrong: see the probes below.)

Timing probes (wrong-result debug builds, all linears, 2 reps):
- EXL3_DEBUG_A_ONCE (activations loaded once per thread): M=64 67.9 -> 65.3 ms, M<=32 ~unchanged. A reload is ~3 ms.
- EXL3_DEBUG_B_FAKE (no trellis decode, B = raw words): M=4 30.7 -> 26.6, M=16 34.6 -> 28.9, M=32 46.3 -> 31.3,
  M=64 67.9 -> 49.3 ms. Decode costs ~4 / 6 / 15 / 19 ms and does not overlap DPAS at M>=32; DPAS+loads alone at
  M=64 is 49 ms (~70 TFLOPS).
- EXL3_BV_ALL (separate B registers per tile so decode j+1 need not wait on dpas j reading shared B): no change
  (M=32 46.3 -> 45.5-46.6, M=64 67.6 -> 67.3-68.1). Rejected. The SLM shared-decode redesign is also off: its
  per-thread operand traffic would be ~4x the current A traffic.
- MAXMB 32 / 16 (split large M into more blocks, re-decoding each tile per block), all linears 2 reps:
  M=32 46.2-46.5 (64) / 46.4-46.6 (32) / 71.4-72.0 (16); M=48 64.4 / 87.3 / 92.0; M=64 67.8-68.2 / 93.1-93.7 /
  140.3-141.1 ms. Current max block 64 stays.

### DPAS MB=24 block (2026-09-23), kept
17..24 rows used to pad to MB=32. New MB=24 (3 x dpas.8x8, NT=2): all linears (2 reps) M=17 43.3 -> 41.1-41.2,
M=20 44.0-44.4 -> 42.1-42.2, M=24 44.9-45.1 -> 42.6-42.7 ms (NT=4 spills: 110-112 ms). Extended Gate A1 (now incl.
DPAS M=24) PASS. Default on (EXL3_NO_DPAS_MB24 opts out). Affects C5-C6 with MTP k=3.

### DPAS MB=40/48 blocks (2026-09-23), kept
33..48 rows used to pad to MB=64. New MB=40/48 (256-GRF, NT=2, split-K target 2048): all linears (2 reps) M=33
59.4-60.0 -> 56.8-57.0, M=40 61.7-62.2 -> 58.3-58.7, M=44 62.8-63.4 -> 60.0-60.6, M=48 64.1-64.4 -> 61.5-61.6 ms.
Extended Gate A1 (incl. DPAS M=40/48) PASS. Default on (EXL3_NO_DPAS_MB48 opts out).

### Interleaved serving (bench/interleave.py, 2026-09-23, B70 #1, thinking on)
4 background streams; arrivals cycling 1K/8K/32K prompts. Baseline (no arrivals): 265.8 tok/s total, 66.4/stream,
max token gap 0.35 s. Arrivals every 10 s (~1400 tok/s prefill demand, ~100% of prefill capacity): 23.1 tok/s,
max gap 7.1 s -- overloaded. Arrivals every 30 s, by max_num_batched_tokens (prefill chunk):
| chunk | bg decode tok/s | max gap | p99 gap | TTFT 1K / 8K / 32K |
| 8192 | 180.3 | 7.09 s | 53 ms | 0.92 / 5.32 / 24.4 s |
| 4096 | engine DEVICE_LOST (xe job timeout in decode graph replay) | | | |
| 2048 | 172.2 | 1.95 s | 66 ms | 0.92 / 5.70 / 26.2 s |
| 1024 | 162.4 | 1.08 s | 726 ms | 1.22 / 6.35 / 29.4 s |
| 512 | 140.2 | 0.70 s | 588 ms | 10.8 / 8.0 / 38.3 s |
2048 is the balance (freeze 7.1 -> 1.95 s for -4% decode, -7% 32K TTFT). The DEVICE_LOST hung inside XPU graph
replay (5 s xe job timeout), like the earlier C16 crash; repro + 2048 soak running.

### Exact KV block size (EXL3_KV_BLOCK_EXACT=1), kept (2026-09-24)
vLLM XPU rounded the hybrid-negotiated attention block (1600 tokens = GDN state page) up to 2048 and padded
every page to 4 MiB. The patch keeps 1600 (a multiple of 64, as the GDN kernel needs). KV pool 267,761 ->
272,570 tokens; C16 thinking-on 10 -> 13-14 streams running. Thinking on, agg tok/s: C16 prose 349.1 -> 409.9,
code 294.6 -> 344.2 (+17%); C1 prose 76.9 -> 76.6, code 61.4 -> 63.3. Vision PASS, 128K needle 3/3.
Default on in model.yaml.

Interleave (4 streams, arrivals every 30 s): chunk 4096 repeat ran clean (the earlier DEVICE_LOST did not
reproduce): 177.1 tok/s, max gap 3.7 s, TTFT 32K 24.8 s. chunk 2048 5-min soak: 175.8 tok/s, max gap 5.6 s,
TTFT 32K 26.3 s (a multi-second stall persists independent of chunk size; cause TBD).
Stall forensics (chunk 4096, 240 s, bench/interleave.py now logs largest gaps + arrival timeline): the 3.7 s
stalls start at 95.9 s and 186.0 s, ~4 s before the 32K arrivals' first tokens (100.1 s, 190.2 s): the final
prefill chunk of a long prompt, batched with the 4 decode streams, attending over ~28-32K of fp8 KV. The
block-dequant fp8 prefill path only fires for single-sequence batches, so mixed batches take vLLM FA2 on fp8
KV (~1.8x slower). Next: extend the fp8-KV prefill patch to mixed batches (prefill rows via block-dequant FA,
decode rows via the stock path). Decode 177.4 tok/s, TTFT 1K/8K/32K p50 0.94/5.41/25.2 s.
Mixed-batch fp8-KV prefill path (decode rows stock, one long prefill chunk via block-dequant): 32K needle under
4-stream load 3/3, but it never fired (the XPU FA metadata does not populate num_decode_reqs/num_prefill_reqs)
and the stall did not change (3.72 s). The stall is the prefill step itself: 4096-token chunks take ~3.1 s
(last chunk at ~32K context ~3.7 s) and decode waits a full step. Left opt-in (EXL3_FP8KV_MIXED=1).
Recipe default max_num_batched_tokens 8192 -> 2048: max decode wait 7.1 -> ~2 s under interleaved load, decode
-3%, 32K prefill ~-6%.
Prefill by chunk (cold, one request): 2048: 4K 1576, 32K 1411, 128K 954 (breaks T2), 254K 672; 4096: 1654 / 1483 /
1020 / 726; 8192: 1589 / 1497 / 1049 / 763. Default set to 4096 (T2 holds, decode wait behind a long prompt 7.1 -> 3.7 s).
MTP k=2 at C16 thinking on (exact KV blocks): all 16 streams resident (84-93% KV); prose 409.9 -> 460.2, code
344.2 -> 383.5 agg (+11-12%). k=2 loses at C1-C4 (C1 prose 61.9 vs 70.3, C4 219.5 vs 237.5), and dynamic SD
cannot switch k on this driver, so default stays k=3; k=2 is the many-users variant.
gpu_memory_utilization 0.985: launch refused (30.97 of 31.89 GiB free at startup). 0.970: KV pool 272,570 -> 288,954
tokens but still 13-14 of 16 streams resident; C16 thinking prose 409.5, code 335.4 (flat). Rejected; 0.965 stays.
mamba_cache_mode default + prefix caching off (with exact blocks, k=3): pool 284,485 tokens, still 14 of 16 streams
resident; C16 thinking prose 405.6, code 345.5 (flat). Rejected. The per-stream GDN state copies for k=3 speculation
are the limit; only k=2 (fewer copies) fits all 16. Remaining capacity lever: smaller GDN state (own kernels).

### Realistic panel (2026-09-24): Gutenberg prose, HumanEval / real-source code, temperature 0.7, cap 16384
bench/sweep.py --corpus real (bench/fetch_corpus.sh), thinking on, current default build, agg tok/s (prose / code):
C1 91.2 / 66.1 (accept 3.42 / 2.75), C2 151.4 / 125.3, C4 262.6 / 212.9, C8 357.1 / 321.7, C16 365.2 / 350.0.
vs the synthetic greedy panel: C1-C8 equal or higher (real prose drafts better), C16 prose lower (thinking runs past
the old 2048 cap, more KV per stream). These become the headline numbers; the synthetic panel stays as reference.
k=2 many-users panel (noise corpus) prose C1 65.8, C2 123.5, C4 227.6, C8 337.4, C16 435.7; code C1 59.0, C2 107.8,
C4 188.9 (C8/C16 code invalid: server killed by an overlapping run; to redo).

### Codebook-affine fold (2026-09-24): opt-in (EXL3_FOLD), not default
sum_k a_k w_k = c1 sum_k a_k h_k + c2 sum_k a_k with h = fp16(1024 + bytesum): the per-weight fp16 mad leaves the
decode loop; row sums come from one extra dpas against an all-ones B per row block; affine applied at the store in
fp32 (unrounded weight, within half an fp16 ulp of exllamav3's hfma weight). DPAS MB<=8 only (MB=16: accumulator
spill, M=16 34.6 -> 70.5 ms). All linears: M=3 30.2 -> 29.2, M=4 31.1 -> 30.0, M=8 32.1 -> 31.0 ms (~3.5%).
linear outputs: M=16..40 bitwise identical to production, M=4/8 differ by <= 0.0078 (fp16 rounding, by design).
But Gate A1's gemm_raw path fails at M=24/40 (unfolded blocks) only in fold builds (EXL3_NO_FOLD build passes);
cause not found. Small gain + unexplained gate anomaly: left opt-in, not shipped.
Vision (bench/vision_bench.py, limits raised to 32 images / 4 videos): 16 numbered images @1024px read back in
order (4/8/16 all OK). Image prefill: 1x512px 281 tok TTFT 0.61 s; 16x1024px 16.4K tok 12.4 s (1322 tok/s);
16x2048px 65.6K tok 69.4 s (945 tok/s); decode with images in context 57-73 tok/s.
Real-text prefill (Gutenberg): 4K 1680, 32K 1476, 128K 1020 tok/s (same as noise, as expected).
Vision robustness: a single 4096x4096 image (the processor's 16.7 MP max, ~65K ViT patches) crashed the engine
(UR OUT_OF_RESOURCES in the vision rotary embedding). mm_processor_kwargs size.longest_edge 4194304 now downscales
large images (~4.1K tokens each): 1x4096px TTFT 3.72 s, 2x4096px 7.54 s, decode 69-73 tok/s; 32 images @512px read
back in order; video and vision tests PASS; 0 OUT_OF_RESOURCES.

## 2026-09-24: DSpark vs MTP re-test at temperature 1.0 (realistic corpus, C1, thinking on) — DSpark REJECTED again
Same prompts, texts captured (`--dump-text`), 120 s window, fp8 KV. DSpark only fits max_model_len 131072 (its draft KV).
| draft | prose tok/s | code tok/s | accept len |
|---|---|---|---|
| MTP k=3 (default) | **82.9** | **67.4** | 2.85 |
| DSpark k=7 | 73.6 | 58.0 | 3.26 |
DSpark accepts more tokens per step but its 7-token draft pass costs more than it saves: -11% prose, -14% code.
An earlier 117 tok/s DSpark prose cell was a degenerate numbered-word output ("final161 worship162 …"), trivially
draftable; it is discarded. Fixes: pruned MTP draft head is built only when the drafter is MTP (~0.25 GB);
sweep captures text and flags LOOP (32-word shingle repeat ratio > 0.2).

## 2026-09-24: dynamic draft length (k=3 at <=8 reqs, k=2 above) — BLOCKED on XPU
vLLM 0.26 `speculative_config.num_speculative_tokens_per_batch_size` forces cudagraph_mode FULL_DECODE_ONLY ->
PIECEWISE ("Dynamic speculative decoding changes the target verification length"); piecewise capture fails on XPU
with UR OUT_OF_RESOURCES at startup. Options left: V2 model runner (untested on XPU) or capturing full graphs per k.

## 2026-09-24: prefix caching was OFF (found while reading the dynamic-k log)
`enable_prefix_caching=False` in the bench server and in the running service: vLLM 0.26 does not enable it by
default for hybrid GDN models, and model.yaml never set it. Now explicit `enable_prefix_caching: true` (with
`mamba_cache_mode: align`). Re-measuring the panel + a same-prompt TTFT/hit-counter check.

### Prefix caching cost: investigated (2026-09-24)
- t=0.7 panel with caching on showed prose C1/C8/C16 -23/-33/-22% (one wave, few samples, card 0 service live).
- Greedy A/B, same prompts: prose C8 caching off 334.0, on 338.2 tok/s -> **no decode cost**. The t=0.7 drop does
  not reproduce; greedy prose C1 loops on its prompt (LOOP flag), so C1 needs the t=0.7 re-measure.
- py-spy: with caching on, 82% of EngineCore time blocks on `num_accepted_tokens_event.synchronize()`
  (gpu_model_runner.py:2127, align mode only); with caching off the same wait sits in XPU graph replay (78%).
  The wait moves, the step time does not.
- `patch_align_sync` (skip that sync except on GDN block crossings / batch changes): greedy 7/8 exact vs
  unpatched, same as unpatched-vs-unpatched 7/8 (one near-tie flip, prompt 1) -> correct; speed C8 prose
  337.7 vs 337.8, code 332.6 vs 331.5 -> no gain. REJECTED as default, kept opt-in (EXL3_ALIGN_SYNC_SKIP=1).

## 2026-09-24: HARDWARE — B70 PCIe links are unstable (root cause of the "crashes")
- 13:08 (container clock) our server died mid-panel ("Abort ... drm_neo.cpp:445", REQ_FAIL from code C4). Kernel:
  AER Data Link Layer Timeout on port c0:01.1, then `pciehp: Slot(19): Link Down / Card not present`, xe re-probed
  c3:00.0 (B70 #1), render node renumbered D132 -> D133.
- Journal: 5 link-down events in 7 days (80:03.1 = B70 #0 slot: Sep 17, 21, 23; c0:01.1 = B70 #1 slot: Sep 23, 24).
  Correctable replay timeouts today: c0:01.1 1280, 80:03.1 334, others 24. Likely signal integrity (risers /
  Gen speed) or ASPM; earlier C16 DEVICE_LOST episodes may be the same fault. Needs a hardware/BIOS decision
  (force lower PCIe gen, pcie_aspm=off, reseat/replace risers) — not changed without the owner.
- The t=0.7 pc-on panel before the drop (prose C16 249.7) is suspect; cells after 13:08 are invalid.

### Codebook lookup table (EXL3_LUT) in the GEMV (2026-09-24): REJECTED
65,536-entry fp16 table (filled by decode_cb_h itself, so bit-exact by construction) in global memory, L1-cached,
replacing mul + dp4a + mad with one gather per weight. All linears, graph-captured, B70 #1, 3 alternating reps:
M=1 27.24 -> 107.65 ms (481 -> 122 GB/s), M=2 31.6 -> 106.5 ms. The per-lane gather rate is ~4x below the ALU
decode rate; an SLM table would need a 128 KB refill per work-group (more bytes than the weights). Left opt-in.

### Scheduler A/B (6400 budget / 4800 long-prompt cap) — not measured: B70 #1 dropped again (2026-09-24 20:32)
Baseline (prefix caching on, chunk 4096) got through 4K 1545 and 32K 1421 tok/s, then B70 #1 fell off the bus
during the 128K prefill (pciehp Slot(19) Link Down, re-enumerated as renderD133) about 5 min into load.
B70 #1 link drops today: 15:08, 16:19, 20:32 (earlier ones needed ~20-25 min of decode; this one ~5 min of prefill).
GPU work on B70 #1 halted until the link is fixed.

### Long-context (200K+) baseline, B70 #1 (2026-09-24, halted by a 4th PCIe drop)
Canonical recipe (MTP k=3, fp8 KV, prefix caching on, align mode, 4096 budget = 3200-token chunks), exl3dev2
container on renderD133. Cold prefill, one request, one wave: 196K **775 tok/s** (TTFT 254 s), 254K **650 tok/s**
(TTFT 391 s; 726 without prefix caching, the align-mode chunk rounding costs ~10% here).
sweep.py `--decode-ctx 200000` is invalid (45 s window ends inside the 254 s prefill): added `bench/longctx.py`
(cold request, then a same-document warm request; per-stream decode after the first token, thinking on).
Its first run logged nothing: the engine went silent at 22:45 (no stats lines) and B70 #1 dropped off the bus
at 00:49 (Slot 19 Link Down, 4th time in 34 h). No decode-at-200K number yet.
Next once a stable card is available: longctx.py at 131K/200K; then max_num_batched_tokens 6400/9600 for
long prompts (fewer align chunks) against interleave stall.

### W8A8 int8 prefill linears (2026-09-25), opt-in `EXL3_INT8_PREFILL=1`
Xe2 XMX int8 runs 2x fp16 (oneDNN `_int_mm` 220-280 TOPS vs fp16 96-137 TFLOPS on B70). Prefill GEMMs already run
in the Hadamard domain, where activations have no outliers (QuaRot setting), and mul1 codebook values are bounded
by 3.453125 (std 1.0), so: per-(group,row) int8 activation scale fused into had_in (`HadInQ8Kernel`), one static
weight scale 3.453125/127 fused into reconstruct (`ReconstructKernel<..., int8_t>`), int32 -> scale -> output
Hadamard (`HadOutQ8Kernel`). Decode (M <= 128) is unchanged and stays bit-exact.
- Kernel check (`tests/test_int8_prefill.py`, real tensors, M=4096): matches a torch reference of the same
  quantization to 4.0e-4; rel err vs fp16 path 1.2-1.3e-2; all linears 1762 -> 1136 ms (1.55x; GEMM alone 2.0x;
  per call on in_proj_qkvz: GEMM 2.86, had_out 0.79 (int32 read, bandwidth-bound), had_in 0.47, recon 0.21 ms).
- Accuracy (`tests/prefill_nll.py`, 8 Gutenberg docs x 2K tokens, teacher-forced): NLL 1.64392 -> 1.64665
  (+0.0027, +0.17% ppl), top-1 agreement with fp16 97.17%, mean |dlogp| 0.061. A real (small) quality cost.
- Served, B70 #1, canonical recipe + prefix caching, cold, one wave each, same boot day (fp16 -> int8):
  32K 1434 -> **1979** (1.38x), 128K 928 -> **1135** (1.22x); 4K cells were first-after-boot (JIT) for both, discarded.
Not in the canonical recipe (quality trade is the user's call). Remaining overhead: had_out reads int32 (2x
bytes), had_in has one thread per row; attention is untouched, so the 200K+ gain is smaller.

### int8 prefill v2: oneDNN fused-scale GEMM + work-group had_in (2026-09-25)
- oneDNN 3.9 (oneAPI, SYCL interop) s8xs8 matmul with the static weight scale as a weights scale and the
  per-row activation scale as a binary-mul post-op, fp16 dst written straight into the fused-shard output;
  output Hadamard then reads fp16 instead of int32. Built when /opt/intel/oneapi/dnnl is present (EXL3_DNNL).
- `HadInQ8WgKernel`: 8 (K<=6144) or 16 (K=17408) threads per row, blocks kept in registers, row max via SLM,
  one pass. qkvz had_in 0.47 -> 0.31 ms/call.
- `tests/test_int8_prefill.py` M=4096: all linears fp16 1762 -> int8 **966 ms (1.82x)**; vs torch reference of the
  same quantization worst 3.2e-4 (PASS). qkvz per call: GEMM 2.78 ms (~247 TOPS, at the measured int8 ceiling),
  had_out 0.55 (fp16, bandwidth-bound), had_in 0.31, reconstruct 0.21.
- Served run not completed: at 06:45 B70 #1's root port c0:01.1 began a flood of corrected AER errors (Data Link
  Layer replay Timeout; 31k Hardware Error lines by 09:20, 483 from c0:01.1) and the engine stalled mid 4K
  prefill at 06:52 with no log for 2.5 h. Link still trains Gen4 x16; errors are on the physical link (riser/slot).
- GQA fold for prefix attention (6 q-heads per kv head folded into the query dim, exact): 3200x32K 75.6 -> 71.7 TF, 4096x32K 78.0 -> 73.0 TF. Rejected.
- omp session replay (real agent traffic) on the v2 build crashed the engine with UR OUT_OF_DEVICE_MEMORY
  after 6 requests: oneDNN's library-mode scratchpad lives outside torch's allocator (not in vLLM's memory
  budget), and every new token count built a new primitive. Fix: user-mode scratchpad allocated through torch,
  GEMM rows padded to multiples of 256 (at most 16 primitives per (K, N)). M=1000 1.78x, M=4096 1.89x, PASS.

### omp session replay, real agent traffic (2026-09-25)
~/tuning-kit bench.py `replay:2` (40 real omp sessions, tools + thinking on, temperature 1; 2 sessions x 12 turns,
same session order for both). Live = user's service on B70 #0 (canonical recipe, fp16 prefill, via the gateway);
int8 = same recipe + EXL3_INT8_PREFILL (v2 + OOM fix) on B70 #1.
| | live (B70 #0) | int8 prefill (B70 #1) |
|---|---|---|
| turns ok / tool-call turns / loops | 24/24 / 24 / 0 | 24/24 / 24 / 0 |
| prompt tokens p50 / max | 18,214 / 62,947 | 18,214 / 62,947 |
| TTFT p50 / p95 | 4.65 / 9.00 s | **3.78 / 8.30 s** |
| wall time for the 24 turns | 193 s | **147 s** |
| decode per stream p50 | 52.1 | 34.2 (see note) |
Notes: turns are short tool calls (~200 output tokens p50), so per-stream decode is noisy and dominated by the
first steps; B70 #1 logged 1,896 corrected AER errors during the run (its decode path is unchanged code), and the
live service may have had other traffic. The gateway does not report cached_tokens, so the harness's
"uncached prefill" figure is not meaningful here and is omitted. First v2 replay OOMed (fixed, above).
- New image 5d8630ed (int8 on by default): 32K cold prefill 2124 tok/s on B70 #1, registry acceptance decode 81.2 tok/s, tool call ok; local-ai-registry PR #97.

### Where a 32K prefill goes now (int8 prefill, vLLM torch profiler, 2026-09-25)
One cold 32K prompt at 2,108 tok/s (15.5 s), XPU kernel time by stage:
| stage | time | share | note |
|---|---|---|---|
| int8 GEMM (oneDNN) | 6.19 s | ~40% | ~286 TOPS: at the measured int8 ceiling |
| had_out / reconstruct / had_in (int8) | 1.00 / 0.74 / 0.62 s | ~15% | had_out bandwidth-bound; reconstruct re-decodes all weights every chunk |
| full attention (cutlass XeFMHA, fp16, prefix blocks + causal) | 2.92 + 0.34 s | ~21% | 17 ms per prefix call; grows with context |
| GDN (gdn_attention + chunk kernels) | ~2.3 s | ~15% | |
| norms / activations / copies | ~1.5 s | ~9% | |
Linears are done; further prefill gains need attention (int8 QK^T, SageAttention-style) and GDN.

### oneDNN Graph fused SDPA for fp8-KV prefill attention (2026-09-25), `EXL3_ONEDNN_ATTN=1`
torch SDPA on XPU (oneDNN fused) ran 93-98 TF at head_dim 256 vs 76 for FA2, but returns no log-sum-exp, which the
32K-block merge needs. oneDNN Graph built directly (`exl3_sdpa`): MatMul -> Divide -> bottom-right causal mask
(GenIndex/Select) -> SoftMax -> MatMul. Findings on the way: `logical_tensor(id, dt, {1}, strided)` picks the
rank overload (ndims=1, unknown dims) -> "invalid logical tensor"; asking SoftMax for stats (LSE) drops to the
unfused `larger_partition_kernel` (materializes scores -> DEVICE_LOST at 3200x32K); without stats it runs the
fused `sdp_primitive_v1` kernel. So: one fused call per KV head over the whole [0, seq_len) with the causal mask
(no merge), K/V of that head dequantized head-major (<= 260 MB at 254K, less than the block path).
Key padding is NOT allowed (the fused kernel takes causal alignment from dims: rel err 0.2-0.8); queries are
padded to 256 at the top (exact). Each distinct seq_len compiles once (cached).
- Kernel (per kv head, causal, vs FA2 one call): L=36K 90.5 vs 69.9 TF, 131K 81.2 vs 67.4, 254K 80.1 vs 65.3;
  maxdiff <= 3.1e-5. tests/test_fp8kv_prefill.py PASS (rel <= 1.7e-4).
- Served, B70 #1, int8 prefill on both, same build/day, cold (FA2 -> oneDNN): 4K 2198 -> **2421** (+10%),
  32K 2104 -> **2259** (+7%), 128K 1234 -> **1415** (+15%), 254K 769 -> **911** (+18%).
  vs the fp16 recipe of this morning (1654 / 1434 / 928 / 650): 1.46x / 1.58x / 1.52x / 1.40x.
- Needle with oneDNN attention + int8 prefill: 3/3 at 131K, 3/3 at 240K. Promoted to model.yaml (EXL3_ONEDNN_ATTN=1).
- Image 21412bdd (int8 prefill + oneDNN attention): 32K 2204 / 128K 1359 tok/s on the published digest, acceptance decode 85.9 tok/s, tool call ok; local-ai-registry PR #102.

### Evals: Terminal-Bench 2.1 attempt (2026-09-25), halted by a 5th B70 #1 PCIe drop
Harbor (omarchy ~/terminal-bench/framework/run.sh, + --n-attempts), dataset terminal-bench/terminal-bench-2-1,
agent terminus-2, 2 attempts x 89 tasks, C8, timeout x20 / agent x100, model = image 21412bdd on B70 #1 (:8102),
thinking on. Traces: omarchy ~/terminal-bench/runs/full/qwen38-b70-20260925T192042Z (copy on the Mac under
~/terminal-bench/runs/omarchy-qwen38-b70/). B70 #1 dropped at 21:37 (slot 19 Link Down) ~17 min in.
Valid trials before the drop: 5 finished by the verifier, 4 passed (kv-store-grpc, log-summary-date-ranges,
openssl-selfsigned-cert, pypi-server), 1 failed (torch-tensor-parallelism); qemu-alpine-ssh failed in the harness
(tmux did not start); the rest are connection errors / cancellations from the drop (not model results).
At C8: 7 requests running, KV 77%, ~250 tok/s aggregate, no preemptions.
GPQA Diamond not run: the dataset is gated and neither the omarchy nor the Mac HF token has access.
- TB 2.1 on B70 #0 (run qwen38-b70-20260925T214804Z, C8, 2 attempts), 21:48 -> 02:01: 9 trials finished before
  the failure; **8/8 verifier-scored trials passed** (kv-store-grpc, log-summary-date-ranges,
  model-extraction-relu-logits, mteb-leaderboard, openssl-selfsigned-cert, pypi-server, regex-log,
  torch-tensor-parallelism); qemu-alpine-ssh failed in the harness (tmux). At C8 the KV pool was full
  (91-96%, 730 preemptions, prefix-cache hits 26% of prompt tokens) but every request finished (0 errors).
  At 01:57 B70 #1 (slot 19, idle) and at ~02:01 B70 #0 (slot 17, port 80:03.1) both lost their PCIe link; the
  eval engine segfaulted, the remaining trials are connection errors (not model results). B70 #0 came back as
  renderD135; the user's live engine was recreated from its saved config on renderD135.
